\title{
Discretization-based Direct Random Sample Generation
}
\description{
The package provides two discretization-based Monte Carlo algorithms, namely the Fu-Wang algorithm and the Wang-Lee algorithm, for random sample generation from a high dimensional distribution of complex structure. The normalizing constant of the target distribution needs not to be known.

## More accurate results can be achieved by increasing the number of dicretization points

x1 <- runif(1e5)
x2 <- runif(1e5)
val <- (x1*(1-x2))^5 * (x2*(1-x1))^3 * (1-x1*(1-x2)-x2*(1-x1))^37
support <- as.data.frame(cbind(val, x1, x2))

## Applying the Fu-Wang algorithm
out1 <- sample.fw(X=support, nc=1e4, n=1e3)
summary(out1)

## Applying the Wang-Lee algorithm
out2 <- sample.wl(X=support, nc=1e4, n=1e3)
summary(out2)
