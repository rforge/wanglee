Title: Discretization-based Direct Random Sample Generation
Version: 0.91
Date: 2013-05-11
Author: Liqun Wang and Chel Hee Lee
Maintainer: Chel Hee Lee <gnustats@gmail.com>
Description: The package provides two discretization-based Monte Carlo algorithms, namely the Fu-Wang algorithm and the Wang-Lee algorithm, for random sample generation from a high dimensional distribution of complex structure. The normalizing constant of the target distribution needs not to be known.
